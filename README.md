# Sorts

These are my implementations of [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort),[Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort),[Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort), and [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) with Javascript.

These were made following [Khan Academy's Algorithms Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms).

This repository was created as study reference for me.

See [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/) for more details regarding different types of sorts and their time/space complexities.
